## Face Recognition App
The app does one thing, but it does it well. It detects the face and place it in a rectangle.

Enter a URL to an image that contains a face and press **"Detect"**. 

Careful! The URL must be less than 2000 characters long and the image must not contain more than one face.

The face is detected using the face-detection-model API from Clarifai. 

Although the features that allow registration and authentication are not yet functional (because I have not yet learned how to implement this) the application can be used without having to go through those steps.
